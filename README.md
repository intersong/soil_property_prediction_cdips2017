# Soil Property Prediction - CDIPS-DSW 2017

Working repo for a project in the
[2017 Data Science Workshop](http://cdips.physics.berkeley.edu/2017-cdips-data-science-workshop/)
organized by the
[Career Development Initiative in the Physical Sciences](http://cdips.physics.berkeley.edu/).

Our project is based on the
[Africa Soil Information Service](http://africasoils.net/services/data/soil-databases/)'s
[kaggle competition dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/afsis-soil-properties).
Our goal is to predict critical soil properties, like pH and phosophrous content,
from readily-acquired infrared spectroscopic data.
